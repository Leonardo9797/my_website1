<h2>A famility passionate about travelling</h2>
<p>My family has always liked to travel. Besides often travelling to Sardinia, where my mother’s family lives, my parents started travelling abroad since my sister and I were very young. understandably, <strong>Europe</strong> has been among the first regions we have visited. <strong>France</strong>, <strong>Spain</strong>, <strong>Germany</strong>, and <strong>United Kingdon</strong> were countries to which we went when my sister and I were very young. Later on, we started making longer and more “exotic” trips, mainly in summer time. The first of these was <strong>India</strong>, where we went when I was just 10. I don’t remember much, but I remember clearly a few moement of that travel, such as the elephant ride in the jungle and the tea plantation. Then we traveled to <strong>Seichelles</strong>, staying for two weeks in an amazing island where I saw the most transparent sea of my life. Then, when I was 14, we traveled to China, where the skyscrapers of Shangai and the Terracotta army where the highlights of our visits.</p>

<h2>My first travel alone: Australia</h2>
<p>When I was 17, I decided to do an exchange in <strong>Australia</strong> for 5 months. This occurred during my penultimate year of high school, and it was a highly impacting experience for me. Spending time away from my family made me grow up immensely and made me become more independent.</p>

<h2>Gap year</h2>
<p>Between the end of my high school and the beginning of my university studies, I took a gap year to better understand what I wanted to do and what my true passions were. And so I went back to <strong>Australia</strong> where I studied for the IELTS exam and worked as a waiter, and then I traveled to <strong>Argentina</strong> where I went to learn Spanish since I knew I would have attended IE University in Madrid in the coming year. Both experiences were incredible as I had the chance to learn about different cultures and to visit places I had never imagined to visit before.</p>
