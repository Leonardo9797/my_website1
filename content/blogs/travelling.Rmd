# My travels

## A famility passionate about travelling

My family has always liked to travel. Besides often travelling to Sardinia, where my mother's family lives, my parents started travelling abroad since my sister and I were very young. understandably, **Europe** has been among the first regions we have visited. **France**, **Spain**, **Germany**, and **United Kingdon** were countries to which we went when my sister and I were very young. Later on, we started making longer and more "exotic" trips, mainly in summer time. The first of these was **India**, where we went when I was just 10. I don't remember much, but I remember clearly a few moement of that travel, such as the elephant ride in the jungle and the tea plantation. Then we traveled to **Seichelles**, staying for two weeks in an amazing island where I saw the most transparent sea of my life. Then, when I was 14, we traveled to China, where the skyscrapers of Shangai and the Terracotta army where the highlights of our visits.

## My first travel alone: Australia


When I was 17, I decided to do an exchange in **Australia** for 5 months. This occurred during my penultimate year of high school, and it was a highly impacting experience for me. Spending time away from my family made me grow up immensely and made me become more independent.

## Gap year

Between the end of my high school and the beginning of my university studies, I took a gap year to better understand what I wanted to do and what my true passions were. And so I went back to **Australia** where I studied for the IELTS exam and worked as a waiter, and then I traveled to **Argentina** where I went to learn Spanish since I knew I would have attended IE University in Madrid in the coming year. Both experiences were incredible as I had the chance to learn about different cultures and to visit places I had never imagined to visit before.
