# Leonardo Riolo's Biography

## Birth

I was born in **Sardinia**, a main Italian island in the centre of the Mediterranean sea. I was born in a small village called **Lanusei** on the 9th of August, 1997. My mother's family comes from Sardinia, and my mother was there for holidays when I was born. My father's name is Silvio, lawyer, and my mother's name is Stefania, fashion agent.I also have a sister, named Valentina.

## Early Life
My mother and father were living in **Milan** when I was born, so there is where I was raised. However, until age 5 when I started going to school, I spent a lot of time in Sardinia where my grandparents would take care of me. This is the reason for my big passion for the sea and the reason why I got so passionate about sailing. 

## Teenagerhood
As explained above, I was raised in Milan, where I attended all my primary and secondary studies. I attended a Scienfic high school, called _Liceo Scienfico Cremona_.During my high school studies, I also went in exchange to **Australia**, where I stayed for six months hosted by my host parents Fiona and Tony. During high school, I practised sailing at a competitive level, as part of the [LNI](https://www.leganavale.mi.it/) sailing junior team. 

## University studies
Once I finished my high school in Milan, I chose to study _business administration_ at [IE University](https://www.ie.edu/university/) in **Spain, Madrid**. Here I studied a wide array of subjects, among which:

1. Economics

2. Finance

3. Marketing
