<h1>Leonardo Riolo’s Biography</h1>
<div id="birth" class="section level2">
<h2>Birth</h2>
<p>I was born in <strong>Sardinia</strong>, a main Italian island in the centre of the Mediterranean sea. I was born in a small village called <strong>Lanusei</strong> on the 9th of August, 1997. My mother’s family comes from Sardinia, and my mother was there for holidays when I was born. My father’s name is Silvio, lawyer, and my mother’s name is Stefania, fashion agent.I also have a sister, named Valentina.</p>

<h2>Early Life</h2>
<p>My mother and father were living in <strong>Milan</strong> when I was born, so there is where I was raised. However, until age 5 when I started going to school, I spent a lot of time in Sardinia where my grandparents would take care of me. This is the reason for my big passion for the sea and the reason why I got so passionate about sailing.</p>
