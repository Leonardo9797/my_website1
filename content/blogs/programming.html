<h1>Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?</h1>
<p>Here we uploaded our first dataset. Thanks to Professor Kostis, the first dataset was about alchool and spirits, so it was an enjoyable first dataset to look at!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)</code></pre>
<p>One of the first simple tasks that was given to us was to use the glimpse function. This allowed us to look at the datasetâ€™s variables in a more comprehensive way.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>glimpse(drinks)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Rows: 193
## Columns: 5
## $ country                      &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Afghanistan&quot;, &quot;Albania&quot;, &quot;Algeria&quot;, &quot;And~
## $ beer_servings                &lt;int&gt; 0, 89, 25, 245, 217, 102, 193, 21, 261, 2~
## $ spirit_servings              &lt;int&gt; 0, 132, 0, 138, 57, 128, 25, 179, 72, 75,~
## $ wine_servings                &lt;int&gt; 0, 54, 14, 312, 45, 45, 221, 11, 212, 191~
## $ total_litres_of_pure_alcohol &lt;dbl&gt; 0.0, 4.9, 0.7, 12.4, 5.9, 4.9, 8.3, 3.8, ~</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>levels(drinks$beer_servings)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## NULL</code></pre>
<p>Here we made our first graph. In this graph we showed the 25 countries where the most consumption of beer takes place. In this graph we explored some features of ggplot and managed to order countries from top (highest beer consumption) to bottom (lowest beer consumption among the highest 25).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>drinks %&gt;%
  slice_max(order_by = beer_servings, n=25) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x=beer_servings, y=reorder(country, beer_servings)))+
  geom_col(colour=&quot;black&quot;, fill=&quot;gold&quot;)+
  labs(
    title=&quot;25 highest beer servings countries&quot;,
    x=&quot;Beer Servings&quot;,
    y=&quot;Country&quot;
  )</code></pre>
